## Summary
Munch Buddy is a web application that matches people who like similar foods. It utilizes the Yelp API to procure cuisine categories and restaurants.  The app allows users to create an account, select cuisine preferences, and make a profile. Passwords are hashed before storing it in the database using Werkzeug, and profile pictures are uploadable using Flask-Uploads. Once signed up, Munch Buddy will pair users based on their Pearson's correlation.  The homepage  displays matched users and features in-app, live messaging with socket.io.
